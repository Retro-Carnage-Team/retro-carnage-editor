A level editor for [Retro-Carnage](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/retro-carnage).

Here you can see the current state of the editor. It's based on the [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) platform -
so you can rearrange the windows as you like.

The tool windows on the left are used to select the mission you want to
work on. Each mission consists of different sections - building the path that the player has to walk.

In the center area you can see a part of the "Berlin" mission with a player model for size comparison. You can drag and
drop visual elements from the palette to onto the mission and move / resize the elements at any time.

All visual elements are organized in layers. You can show / hide or lock / unlock layers with their content to focus on
specific parts of the mission. The Layer window on the right provides easy access to these layers.

Each element of the mission has various properties. These properties can be edited in the Properties window.
